increased size of checkbox!!!!

date is prepopulated with today's date and linked!!

no shift when from all day to normal :)

Questions:

how big do the tasks have to be? ex: 1 task or 10?
How specific do they have to be? (Make an event for UROP vs make even called "UROP this this this")
KLM has to be based on most efficient? ex can type date or click and can make click more efficient...

Want to separate time from date  but not necessarily more efficient
Similarly, error prevention is not more efficient in terms of KLM
resizing?

TODO: put form in div so that it doesnt resize like crazy


task for editing errors


ALLOW USERS TO CLICK ON THE ENTIRE TEXT FIELD TO INSERT DATE

am / pm separate time?
